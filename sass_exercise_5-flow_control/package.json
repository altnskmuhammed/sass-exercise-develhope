The background color, the color, and the font-size can be handled using the flow control (@for, @if, etc...) and the darken and lighten methods (the numbers have a multiplier equal to 5)  In particular, you need to create the classes .fs-1rem, .fs-2rem e .fs-3rem using @each The added colors are black and white only",
